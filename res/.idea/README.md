## 4. How to Use the Program

1. __Register Player__<br>
   The user fills out the approapriate fields in the left pane by providing the following
   information:
    * first name
    * last name
    * date of birth (__yyyy-mm-dd__)
    * preferred positions (`GOALIE`, `DEFENDER`, `MIDFIELDER`, `FORWARD`)
    * skill level (1 to 5)<br><br>

   Alternatively, the user can use the __"Use Sample List"__ button to register a list of 25 preset
   players.
   Note that by doing this, players who are already registered will be removed.<br><br>
2. __Create Team__<br>
   Once there are at least 10 registered players, the user can use the __"Create Team"__ button to
   generate a team.
   The team will be formed with up to 20 players. If there are more than 20 players, the top 20
   players with the highest skill levels will be selected.
   Jersey numbers from 1 to 20 are randomly and uniquely assigned to each team player.
   Positions (1 `GOALIE`, 2 `DEFENDER`, 3 `MIDFIELDER`, 1 `FORWARD`) are assigned prioritizing
   players with the highest skill level.<br><br>

3. __Viewing Team Information__<br>
   Once a team created, the application automatically selects the __"Team Players"__ tab on the
   right pane.
   To view the starting line-up, select the __"Starting Line Up"__ tab.
   To view a list of registered players, select the __"Registered Players"__ tab.<br><br>

4. __Register Player After Team Creation__<br>
   The user can continue to add players after team creation.
   However, the team information will not be updated until the __"Create Team"__ button is clicked
   again.<br><br>

   The user can remove all registered players and the generated team by clicking the __"Reset All"__
   button.<br><br>

## 5. Design/Model Changes

* The following has been changed since the previous version:
    * detection of duplicate players when adding a new player
    * removal of all registered players and team information as a new public method

## 6. Assumptions

* Multiple players with the exact same information do not exist.
* The minimum number of players to form a team is 10.
* The maximum number of players in a team is 20.
* The maximum age of players is 10.
* Players of a very young age (as low as 0) is able to play soccer.
* There are exactly 1 goalie, 2 defenders, 3 midfielders, and 1 forward on a team.

## 7. Limitations

* The current version does not support the following:
    * removal of registered players
    * editing of registered players
    * registration of a second player with the exact same information
    * changing of the number of players on the team
    * changing of the number of each position on the team
    * identication of players with identical names
    * editing of age restriction of players
    * retrieval of players/team information after exiting
    * manual assignment of jersey numbers and positions
